# hello-world
My first repository
This is my first stab at git hub never used it before.  I am a self taught data scientist and data analyst.  I have an MBA in services marketing and have been both an entropreneur and a director of a fortune 500 company.  I wish to expand my programming skills which include Python, SQL, and R and am currently looking for work as a data scientist or analyst.
